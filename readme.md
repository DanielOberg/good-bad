What's this?
============

*Short version. It's a free tool for helping yourself
stay motivated. It works exactly like a chess clock and you try to find
strategies to minimize your procastination with it.*

You decided that tomorrow you would work from home, *really work*, all day long.
So you wake up and think to yourself I have to eat some breakfast first. You
might as watch some TV or surf the internet while you eat. Why not? You like
multitasking! Should really get to work now. Well after cleaning your desk. Time
for lunch! Already that late? *You will do better tomorrow, I'm sure of it!*

Familiar? Well break that habit with this multi-purpose tool! All you need to do
is to input the *number of hours you would like to spend on work* (we call them
"good hours") and how much time you would like to spend on other things like
snacky snack time (bad hours).

When you click on either good or bad the count-down timer will start. You can
then freely switch between the good time and the bad time countdown, like a
chess clock.

The goal of this game-against-yourself is simple. *Finish the good time counter
before the bad time counter.* How you wish to spend the bad time and when you
wish to switch between them is all up to you, but remember: *your time IS
limited*.



Benefits
=========

The concept is extremely simple yet it forces you to take action by:

1. prioritizing your non-working time
2. realizing you have a limited amount of time to be spent
3. discover time-wasters (your completed session is visualized)

Like any good game, you need to find a good strategy.


Rules
=====

1. If your bad hours time is up before good hours you loose
2. No less than one hour on each must be set
3. Anything that is not considered work is bad time. Even if it just is a
   bathroom break

Good luck with your work.  Signed: Daniel Ã–berg
