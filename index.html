        <h2>What's this?</h2>

      <p>
      <em class="summary">
      Short version. It's a free tool for helping yourself stay motivated. It works 
      exactly like a chess clock and you try to find strategies to minimize your 
      procastination with it.
      </em>
      </p>
      <p>
      You decided that tomorrow you would work from home, really work, all day long.
      So you wake up and think to yourself I have to eat some breakfast first.
      <em>You might as watch some TV</em> or surf the internet while you eat. Why not?
      You like multitasking! <em>Should really get to work now.</em> Well after cleaning
      your desk. Time for lunch! Already that late? You will do better tomorrow,
       I'm sure of it!
      </p>
      <p>
      Familiar? Well break that habit with this multi-purpose tool! All you need 
      to do is to input the number of hours you would like to spend on work (we 
      call them "good hours") and how much time you would like to spend on other 
      things like snacky snack time (bad hours).
      </p>
      <p>
      When you click on either good or bad the count-down timer will start. You
      can then freely <em>switch between the good time and the bad time countdown.</em>, 
      like a chess clock.
      </p>
      <p>
      <em>The goal of this game-against-yourself is simple. Finish the good time counter 
        before the bad time counter.</em> How you wish to spend the bad time and when you 
      wish to switch between them is all up to you, but remember: <em>your 
        time IS limited.</em>
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>Benefits</h2>
      <p>The concept is extremely simple yet it forces you to take action by:</p><br />
      <ol>
        <li>prioritizing your non-working time</li>
        <li>realizing you have a limited amount of time to be spent</li>
        <li>discover time-wasters (your completed session is visualized)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Like any good game, you need to find a good strategy.</p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p></p>
      <ol>
        <li>No less than one hour on each must be set</li>
        <li><em>Anything that is not considered work is bad time.</em> Even if it
        just is a bathroom break</li>
        <li><em>If your bad hours time is up before good hours you loose</em></li>
      </ol>

      <p><br />Good luck with your work, Go(o)d help us.</p>
